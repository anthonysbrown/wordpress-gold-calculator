This plugin allows you to have a gold calculator on your website which you can define the gold prices based on the standard going rate.

== Description ==

DLG Results has released a gold calculator plugin for companies who wish to buy gold. This calculator pulls the most current gold prices from DGCSC every 15 minutes. The plugin allows you to set a percentage payout amount. This means you can show an accurate estimate on what you will pay out to the customer should they sell gold to you. The gold Calculator features calculations for each grade from 10k -24k and the user can input the amount of gold they have in either grams or penny weights. There is a simple shortcode for invoking the gold calculator explained below. There are many more features coming so stay subscribed and drop us a line for feature recommendations. Plugin is developed with the popular javascript framework Jquery. We can also provide the plugin in non wordpress format.
